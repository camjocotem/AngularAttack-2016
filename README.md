# AngularAttack-2016

This was my first entry into the AngularAttack hackathon of 2016
I decided to try and replicate the classic arcade game pong.

I had a lot of fun making this, and while I didn't have experience in game libraries such as PhaserJS at the time, I was quite happy what I'd achieved using only AngularJS/html/css
